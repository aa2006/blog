              Both will get their respective projects pre-merger back.<br><br>
              The CobwebAclevo Twitter will go back to the original owners after a period of time in where we can migrate followers to the Cob:web Twitter also.
              Any projects created as part of the Cob:web-Aclevo group will be split in the withdrawl agreement.<br><br>
          
          Upon the signing of this agreement, both whyAdamSalt#9054 and Reasonably Selenium#3815 agree to merge Cob:web Development and Aclevo into “The Cob:web-Aclevo Group”, “Cob:web-Aclevo Group” and “Cob:web-Aclevo” as the official brand names. The two brands will officially merge upon the signing of this agreement.<br><br>
